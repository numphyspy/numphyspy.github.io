    p. 124 For elimination (third bullet point) not to impact the determinant, this should refer (not to a linear combination, but) to “the sum of that row/equation with a multiple of any other row/equation”.
    p. 306 Problem 11 should say “Taylor expand f(x^{(k-1)}) and f(x^{(k-2)})“. Then, it should say “Plug these relations”.
    p. 363 “Observe that in \partial p(x)” –> “Observe that in \partial p(x_j)“
    p. 390 Problem 29 should be referring to polynomials with 2, 3, and 4 parameters (and “third degree” –> “three-parameter case” and “fourth-degree” –> “four-parameter case”)
    p. 436 In Eq. (7.120), there should be no product symbol
    p. 437 In Eq. (7.128), the sum should be over k
    p. 459 In fn 42, the integrand should be using x’
    p. 490 In problem 26, it would be more appropriate to say that I_4 can be given in terms of the first and second complete elliptic integrals
    p. 491 In problem 31, Y_0 = (X_0 - \mu)/\sigma^2 –> Y_0 = (X_0 - \mu)/\sigma
    p. 491 In problem 34, you’re supposed to use Gauss-Legendre for “n = 5-30“
    p. 493 Problem 43: “the fact that H_1(x) = 2x” –> “the needed Hermite polynomials”
    p. 556 Problem 25, w(0)=1 –> w(0)=0
